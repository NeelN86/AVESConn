This is a program that acts as search function for a databse, and uses embeddings and a transformer model to return results for a specific prompt. I utitlized this program to create an alumni matching service for my high school. Students are prompted to enter their interests and career goals, which are then compared to alumni information that my team and I collected. The service results in 10 alumni who are best suited to give the student advice and mentorship. This is simply the back-end, and I utilized anvil to create the front-end programming of the service.
